## Hotel California

```
(Bm)  On a dark desert highway,    (F#)  cool wind in my hair
      Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,       she got the Mercedes bends
===>  Last thing I remember,             I was running for the door
(A)   Warm smell of colitas                (E) rising up through the air
      She got a lot of pretty pretty boys,     she calls friends
      I had to find the passage back           to the place I was before
(G)   Up ahead in the distance,        (D)  I saw a shimmering light
      How they dance in the courtyard,      sweet summer sweat.
      'Relax,' said the night man,          'We are programmed to receive.
(Em)  My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, (F#)  I had to stop for the night
      Some dance to remember,                         some dance to forget
      You can check-out any time you like,            But you can never leave!'(End)
(Bm)  There she stood in the doorway;  (F#)  I heard the mission bell
      So I called up the Captain,            'Please bring me my wine'
===>  Mirrors on the ceiling,                The pink champagne on ice
(A)   And I was thinking to myself this could be    (E) heaven or this could be hell
      He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here         since nineteen sixty nine'
      And she said 'We are all just prisoners here,     of our own device'
(G)   Then she lit up a candle,          (D) and she showed me the way
      And still those voices are calling     from far away,
      And in the master's chambers,          They gathered for the feast
(Em)  There were voices down the corridor,   (F#) I thought I heard them say
      Wake you up in the middle of the night,     Just to hear them say...
      They stab it with their steely knives,      But they just can't kill the beast
1/2:(G)Welcome to the (D)Hotel California.
1/2:(F#)Such a lovely place, (Bm)such a lovely face
1:(G)Plenty of room at    (D)the Hotel California
2:(G)They livin' it up at (D)the Hotel California
1:(Em)Any time of year (any time of year)          (F#)you can find it here
2:(Em)What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), (F#)Bring your alibis

## Take Me Home, Country Roads

Capo: 4

```
G               Em               D                    C         G
Almost Heaven;  West Virginia,   Blue Ridge Mountains,Shenandoah River.
All my memories gather round her,miner's lady,        stranger to blue water.
G                   Em                   D
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains,
Dark and dusty,    painted on the sky,   misty taste of moonshine,
  C             G
Blowin like a breeze.
Teardrop in my eye.
[Chorus]
         G              D            Em         C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
         G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
[Bridge]
Em           D            G
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
     C       G              D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
     Em               F            C
And driving down the road I get a feeling
         G                          D          D7
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

##  Take me to your heart

Capo: 0 or 2

```
G                                        Em
Hiding from the rain and snow,Trying to forget but I won't let go
Standing on a mountain high,  Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
C                                D
Looking at a crowded street,     Listening to my own heart beat
I should go and see some friends,But they don't really comprehend
Em                  Bm7     C                G
So many             people  all around the world
Don't need too much talking without saying anything
Em                  Bm7 Am                    D
Tell me where do I find someone like you      girl
All I need is      someone who makes me wanna sing
                G                      Em   C                D
Take me to your heart take me to your soul, Give me your hand before I'm old
                G                      Em   C                D
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue, Show me that wonders can be true
         Bm7            Em      Am          D
They say nothing lasts forever, We're only here today
Bm7            Em     Am            D
Love is now or never, Bring me far away
               G                      Em
Take me to your heart take me to your soul
               C                D
Give me your hand and hold me
                 G        Em
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
        Am    D              G
It's easy, take me to your heart

## The Eagles - Waiting in the Weeds

Capo: fret 1
```
(G)It's comin' on the (Em)end of August, (G)Another summer's promise (Em)almost gone
(C)And though I heard some wise man say, (G)That every dog will have his day
He never (F)mentioned that these dog days get (Am)so long(D)
(G)I don't know when I realized (Em)the dream(G) was over  
Well, there was no (Em)particular hour, no given day
You know, it (C)didn't go down in flame  
There was no (G)final scene, no frozen frame
(F)I just watched it slowly fade (Am)away (D)
[Chorus]
And (Em)I've been waiting in (G)the weeds  
Waiting for my (Am)time to come (C)around again and
(Em)Hope is floating on the (G)breeze  
Carrying my (Am)soul high up (C)above the ground and
(Em)I've been keepin' to (G)myself  Knowin' 
that the (Am)seasons are (C)slowly changing
(Em)Even though you're with somebody (G)else  
He'll never love you (Am)like I do(C) ==========
(G)I've been biding time with the (Em)crows and sparrows  
(G)While peacocks prance and strut upon (Em)the stage 
If finding (C)love is just a dance  (G)Proximity and chance
You will (F)excuse me if I skip the (Am)masquerade (D)
[Chorus]
And (Em)I've been waiting in (G)the weeds  
Waiting for the (Am)dust to settle down (C)along the
(Em)Back roads running through the (G)fields  
Lying on the (Am)outskirts of this (C)lonesome town
(Em)And I imagine sunlight in your (G)hair, You're at the county (Am)fair
You're holding (C)hands and laughing, (Em)And now the ferris wheel has (G)stopped
You're swinging on the (Bm)top, Suspended (F#)there with him
(G)And he's the darling of the (D)sheik, The flavor of the (Bm)week is (F#)melting
(G)Down your pretty summer (D)dress, Baby, what a (F#)mess you're making
[Solo]
Bm   A#5+    D   A#5+   
(Bm)I've been stumbling through some (A#5+)dark places        
(D)Now I'm following the (A#5+)plow
(Bm)I know I've fallen out of your (A#5+)good graces  
(Am)It's alright (D)now
(Em)And I've been waiting in the (G)weeds  
Waiting for the (Am)summer rain to (C)fall upon the
(Em)Wild birds scattering the (G)seeds  
Answering the (Am)calling of the (C)tide's eternal tune
(Em)The phases of the (G)moon  
The chambers of (Am)the heart
The egg and (C)dart of small gray  
(Em)Spiders spinning in the (G)dark
In spite of all the (Am)times the web is torn (C)apart
And (Em)I've been waiting in the (G)weeds  
Waiting for the (Am)time to come (C)around again and
(Em)Hope is floating on the (G)breeze  
Carrying my (Am)soul high up (C)above the ground and
(Em)I've been keeping to (G)myself  
Knowing that the (Am)seasons are (C)slowly changing
(Em)Even though you're with somebody (G)else  
He'll never love you like I (Am)do~ (G)
Em    G    Am       C      Em

## The Sound of Silence

```
(Am)Hello darkness, my old (G)friend,
I've come to talk with you (Am)again,
Because a vision (F)softly creeping(C),
Left its seeds while I (F)was sleeping(C),
And the (F)vision that was planted (C)in my brain
Still (Am)remains
(C)Within the (G)sound of (Am)silence.
                        G          Am
In restless dreams I walked alone  Narrow streets of cobblestone,
And in the naked light I saw,      Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                   F        C                                F        C
'neath the halo of a street lamp,  I turned my collar to the cold and damp
People talking without speaking,   People hearing        without listening
        F                                        C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
People writing songs that voices never share
                 Am    C              G        Am
That split the night,  And touched the sound of silence.
And no one dare,       Disturb the sound of silence.
                         G                             Am
Fools said I, you do not know,   Silence like a cancer grows.
And the people bowed and prayed, To the neon God they made.
                     F           C                      F           C
Hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you.
And the sign flashed out its warning, In the words that it was forming.
C      F                            C  Am C       G                 Am
But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed In the wells of silence
                       F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
        F                       C                C    Am
Are written on the subway walls And tenement halls.
         C           G         Am
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.

## Sunshine In The Rain

Key: C#, Capo: 2
```
Am          Dm7            G                         C                     Am
When I'm in Berlin you're off to London, When I'm in New York you're doing Rome
Wishing we could be more telepathic,     Tired of the nights I sleep       alone
Even if we call the highest power,       We can only do one town a         time 

                Dm7             G                             C
All those crazy nights we spend together,  As voices on the     phone
Wishing we could redirect the traffic,     And find ourselves a home
Words are not enough action speaks louder, Second time          around

                 F                G                         G               C 
Can you feel the raindrops in the desert, Have you seen the sunraise in the dark
               F                 G          G                               Am
Do you feel my love when I'm not present, Standing by your side while miles apart
                Dm7                     G                      C
Sunshine in the rain, Love is still the same, Sunshine in the rain

## Eagles - Lying Eyes

Capo: 3

```
G  Gmaj7 C Am D7 G
[Verse]
G               Gmaj7            C
City girls just seem to find out early, 
Am                            D7
how to open doors with just a smile.
  G                Gmaj7             C
A rich old man and she won't have to worry; 
       Am              C              G
she'll dress up all in lace and go in style.
G               Gmaj7              C
Late at night a big old house gets lonely;
  Am                                 D7
I guess every form of refuge has its price.
G                          Gmaj7             C
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
      Am            C                G   C D   
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice.
       G                  Gmaj           C
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
    Am                                 D7
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down.
    G                    Gmaj7          C
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin';
      Am              C                G
She's headed for that cheatin' side of town.
[Chorus]
          G   C           G              Em   Bm            Am      D
You can't hide your lyin' eyes, and your smile is a thin disguise.
             G  G7         C  A7      Am              D                G
I thought by now you'd realize there ain't no way to hide those lying eyes.
[Verse]
       G                  Gmaj7          C
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
    Am                                 D7
with stormy eyes and dreams no-one could steal
    G                    Gmaj7          C
She drives on throught the night anticipating
       Am                 C               G        C   D
Cos he makes her feel the way she used to feel
       G                  Gmaj           C
She rushes to his arms they fall together
    Am                                 D7
She whispers that its only for a while
    G                    Gmaj7          C
She says that soon she'll be coming back forever
      Am              C                G
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile
[Chorus]
          G   C           G              Em   Bm            Am      D
You can't hide your lyin' eyes, and your smile is a thin disguise.
             G  G7         C  A7      Am              D7                G
I thought by now you'd realize there ain't no way to hide those lying eyes.
[Verse]
    G           Gmaj7           C
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
    Am                                D7
And stares out at the stars up in the sky.
 G                  Gmaj7      C
Another night, it's gonna be a long one;
    Am                  C                 G                
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.
    G           Gmaj7           C
And she wonders how it ever got this crazy
    Am                                D7
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
 G                  Gmaj7      C
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
    Am                  C                 G    
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool
G              Gmaj7              C
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things;
    Am                           D7
You set it up so well, so carefully.
         G              Gmaj7           C 
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things;
       Am                 C                G
You're still the same old girl you used to be.
[Chorus]
           G   C           G              Em   Bm            Am      D
You can't hide your lyin' eyes, and your smile is a thin disguise.
             G  G7         C  A7      Am              D                G
I thought by now you'd realize there ain't no way to hide those lying eyes.

I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over

If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further

This ain't lust, I know this is love... But

Should I leave it there?
C             Em             Am
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Em         F       G     C
Even if it leads nowhere?
[Verse]
C                     G
I build myself up and fly around in circles
        Em                       F
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
    Am             Em
Finally could this be it? Or..
[Chorus]
C             Em             Am
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Em         F       G
Even if it leads nowhere?
C                Em         Am           Em
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
         F        G
Should I leave it there?
C             Em             Am
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Em         F       G     C
Even if it leads nowhere?
[Bridge]
F                            Em
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
     Am            Em
Even if it leads nowhere?
            F                    Em
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
           Am                    G 
Should I leave it there? Should I give up? 
            C         Em    Am   Em
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements
         C         Em    Am   Em       
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
[Interlude]
Em F  Or..
[Chorus]
C             Em             Am
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Em         F       G
Even if it leads nowhere?
C                Em         Am           Em
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
         F        G
Should I leave it there?
C             Em             Am
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Em         F       G     C
Even if it leads nowhere?
